# Harmony (.hrm)
## About
Harmony is an esoteric programming language (esolang) modeled on popular texting conventions. It is named in reference to the messaging app Discord. In essence, it is a reskinned, more limited version of Java with elements of Python syntax.

It was created as the first-semester project for Advanced Computer Science Topics/Principles (COM335/161). 

## Usage
Running the harmony.jar file in the command line will prompt the user for a file name. It will then open that file using a custom "Notepad" text editing interface with open, create, save, and run file functionalities.

The following code prints "Hello World!" in the terminal.
```
